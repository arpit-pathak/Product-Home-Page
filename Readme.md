## What I learned from this Project? 

- Learned about the filter property "drop-shadow" to give shadow to svg files. I haven't used "box-shadow" property, Because it gives shadow to the whole svg file, and that is not what I want here.

- Learned about pseudo classes  :first-child and :last-child.
- Learned about Flexbox and its properties justify-content & align-items.
- Learned to select child element in html with the help of child doctor (>)


## Time taken to finish this project ‚è≥
